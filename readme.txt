README

some weird bugs:
Steam VR component is probably needed,
as when we try to run with oculus VR plugin there is some bug causing the engine to crash.

The delta time seems a bit weird as everything become faster after the last commit and pushes it to github.

when you get teleported to second stage,
there will have no traffic light sound before swapping light signal.
probably problem of sound atteuation.
if you want to test the second stage separately please use current camera location to play.

In some unknown situation turning camera angle(moving your head) could lead to changing camera position at the same time
probably deal to oculus rift s problem or amd graphic card driver.


Finally,
if everything is fine, then just run it on VR preview. control the player with wasd and mouse.
